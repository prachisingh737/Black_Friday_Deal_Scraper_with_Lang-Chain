# Black_Friday_Deal_Scraper_with_Lang-Chain

## Overview
In the era of e-commerce, finding better products and understanding product pricing trends is a key focus for both businesses and consumers. This project demonstrates a comprehensive pipeline for scraping product data from e-commerce platforms, saving that data in a structured format, and using LLM-based analysis to identify patterns, extract insights, and assist users in making informed purchase decisions. By combining automation and AI, the notebook emphasizes practical methods to enhance the shopping experience, offering a transparent and interpretable approach to deal discovery.




## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Lang Chain**
- For this project, we will be using the following libraries:
**pandas** for managing and analyzing the scraped data.
**numpy** for performing numerical operations on datasets.
**beautifulsoup4** for scraping and parsing product data from e-commerce websites.
**matplotlib** for visualizing trends and comparisons in the data.
**openai** for leveraging LLM-based analysis on the scraped data.
**langchain** for creating pipelines that integrate LLMs with external tools and data.
